# Kmeans Implementation

## About The Project
We implemented the 2D Kmeans algorithm in three different ways:
1) A sequential mode in Python
2) A Parallel mode in OpenMP
3) A Parallel mode in Cuda

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy and run some tests follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git clone https://github.com/FedeNoce/Kmeans.git
```
2. Chose the implementation:  ```kmeans_seq.py``` for sequential, ```Kmeans_openMp.cpp``` for parallel with OpenMP, ```2D_kmeans_cuda.cu``` for parallel with CUDA.
3. Choose the dataset and copy the file path in the implementation
4. Set the parameters with your tests necessities
5. Run the tests
6. Evaluate the clustering of the tests running ```evaluate_kmeans.py```
